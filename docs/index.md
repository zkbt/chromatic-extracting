`chromatic_extracting` (ğŸŒˆğŸ§ƒ) aims to be a friendly and beautifully illustrated toolkit for extracting time-series spectra from astronomical images, with a primary goal of measuring the transmission and emission of light from the atmospheres of planets both near and far. 

Here are a few places to get started.

- [What's the ğŸŒˆğŸ§ƒ plan?](outline.ipynb) shows the core steps we hope to implement.
- [Contributing ğŸŒˆğŸ§ƒ Code with GitHub](github.ipynb) shows how to use github to collaboratively contribute code.
- [Writing ğŸŒˆğŸ§ƒ Documentation](documentation.ipynb) summarizes how to add to the documentation.
